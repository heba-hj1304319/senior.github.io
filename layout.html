        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
            Mobile devices are being used so widely, however, it comes with a major problem which is the small screen size that is not convenient for reading. Therefore, our Android application which act as a prereader, will go through the whole document and give the user a summary with the main ideas in a clear and neat way. It will follow a summarizing algorithm that will rank the sentences relevance. The user can either search for a webpage, or import from mobile memory a document to be summarized. In addition, the summarized text is easier to be converted to speech than a whole document, which will help people with visual aids.
        </p>

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
            Reading is one of the most important activities that provides mental stimulation, reduces stress, as well as improves knowledge. The fact that nowadays a phone is becoming an essential part in peopleâ€™s life made many people prefer reading on their mobile phones. This can be used as a leeway to make them read more. However, reading long texts from a mobile phone can seem a bit annoying to some people. To help people read more, we developed our summarizer application that will solve the problem of reading lengthy articles and giving them a nice simple text that is easy to read and understand.
